# Tower of Hanoi Game
A project in Ruby Object Oriented Programming by [Viking Code School](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/professional-development-with-ruby/object-oriented-warmups-i).

Tower of Hanoi is a game that requires players to move a stack of disks from one space (or rod) to another, obeying the following simple rules:
  - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
  - No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This is a command line game. You can play it online at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@Agathasta/mastermind#README.md).
